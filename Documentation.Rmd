<h3 class = "text-secondary">A) Shot Chart</h3>

#### Input variables : 
1. Season
2. Player

<details>
<summary> Data and Visualisation Choices</summary>

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 1) The Data</h5>

The data necessary for this visualisation was scraped from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a>, partly inspired from an <a href="https://www.owenlhjphillips.com/new-blog/2020/6/11/how-to-download-nba-shot-data-with-r">Owen Phillips blog post</a> adaptation of the {ballr} package (which proposed a function for scraping a particular dataset from the NBA.com API).

Plenty of datasets are accessible from the NBA.com API, which was the main source for the project.

For this specific visualisation, the goal was to visualise **shooting volume** and **shooting efficiency** by zone for each NBA player.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_shot_data_player(player, season)}` <br>
For this specific dataset, I joined the **league-wide** shooting volume and efficiency data to the **player specific data** in order to get a sense of the **player's efficiency by zone**, compared to league average.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_shot_data_player("Stephen Curry", season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```


* `{get_subtitles_tbl(player, season)}`<br>
I also gathered the **traditional statistics** of the player necessary for the plot subtitles (points, overall 2 point shot efficiency, overall 3 point shot efficiency)

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_subtitles_tbl("Stephen Curry", season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

* `{get_team_logo_from_player(player, season)}` & `{get_player_picture(player, season)}`<br>
Finally, I created functions to get the urls for the **Player Pictures** and **Team Logos**

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

The visualisation is inspired from Espn's Kirk Goldsberry's infamous **shot charts**, and the <a href="https://www.owenlhjphillips.com/new-blog/2020/6/25/how-to-make-nba-shots-charts-in-r">code for drawing the court</a> also comes from Owen Phillips' adaptation of the ballr package.

Instead of the tricky hexbins, I went with a **shooting proficiency scatterplot** with a size variable associated with volume and a fill variable associated with efficiency.
In order to have more flexibility drawing the legends than using the traditional `{ggplot2}` API, I drew the two legends as separate ggplots, which I then added to the scatterplot using the `{patchwork}` package.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the player pictures and team logo.

I will have to tweak the size parameter variable of the geom points, as it does not discriminate the variance in volume shooting enough in my view.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_court(player = "Stephen Curry", season = "2020-21")` and shows the shooting performance of **Stephen Curry** in the **2020-21 NBA Season**.
As we can see, he was both a prolific and efficient shooter this season.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **Shooting Volume :** Number of shots attempted by the player in each location
* **Shooting Efficiency :** Difference between the Shooting Percentage the player achieved and the League Average in each location

<details>
<summary> Data and Visualisation Choices</summary>

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 1) The Data</h5>

The data necessary for this visualisation was partly scraped from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a> and partly scraped from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html#advanced_stats::27">basketball-reference</a>.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_mean_ts_pct(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://widgets.sports-reference.com/wg.fcgi?css=1&site=bbr&url=%2Fleagues%2FNBA_2020.html&div=div_advanced-team">basketball-reference</a> website to get the League Average efficiency metric used for the following visualisation, **True Shooting Percentage**.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_mean_ts_pct(season = "2020-21")
```

* `{get_scoring_rate(season)}` <br>

For this specific dataset, I scraped the per-possession statistics from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=GP&dir=-1x">NBA.com API</a> to get the 100 **best volume scorers** in a specific season, as well as their **shooting efficiency**.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_scoring_rate(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

In order to speed up the r code, I used the `{future}` version of the `{purrr}`package, the `{furrr}` package.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **mapping** of the best scorers in the NBA in terms of volume and efficiency.

In order to get a more complete picture of the situation, I used the `{ggiraph}` package to customize the geom points tooltip to add the selected player's name, picture and relevant statistics using HTML and CSS.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_scoring_rate(team = "San Antonio Spurs", season = "2020-21")` and puts forth the best scorers of the **2020-21 NBA Season** while highlighting the **San Antonio Spurs** players.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **True Shooting Percentage :** A Compounded measure of a player's efficiency taking into consideration its 2 point shot %, 3 point shot % and Free Throw % as well as the volume of each shot type
* **Scoring Rate :** Points scored every 75 possessions by a player, it is a measure of a player's scoring volume independent of the pace of a basket-ball game (meaning the number of possessions played in a game

The goal for this visualisation was to provide a ranking of the **top 10 best players** in each of the main statistical categories.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_bpm_join(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html#advanced_stats::27">basketball-reference</a> website in order to join an all-in-one metric designed to estimate Overall player impact, **Box Plus-Minus**, which has an offensive, and defensive component, to the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1">NBA.com API-scraped</a> player statistics. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_bpm_join(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **ranked bar chart** of the 10 best NBA players in a specific statistical category, in a specific season.

In relevant instances (Box Plus-Minus and Rebounding), the offensive and defensive components of the metric are highlighted so as to put forth the statistical particularities of each player.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the player pictures as axis.

In order to get a more complete picture of the situation, I used the `{ggiraph}` package to customize the geom points tooltip to add the selected player's name, picture and relevant statistics using HTML and CSS.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_player_ranking_interactive(variable = "bpm", season = "2020-21")` and puts forth the best players of the **2020-21 NBA Season** in terms of **Box Plus-Minus**.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **BPM :** Box Plus-Minus is an all-in-one metric that assesses a player's value based on the player's statistical profile as well as the results of the team while the player is on the court
* **Rebound :** A rebound is performed when a player obtains the ball after a missed field goal attempt. Rebounds can be Offensive (when the player's team missed the shot) or Defensive (when the opponent missed the shot)
* **Block :** A block is performed when a player tips or deflects an opponent's shot
* **Steal :** A steal is performed when a player intercepts the ball

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **table** of the 25 best NBA players in the selected statistical category, in a specific season.

I used the `{gt}` package to customize the table, but might decide to look into the `{reactable}` API for this visualisation in my final output, should I prefer an interactive table.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_players_table(variable = "bpm", season = "2020-21")` and puts forth the best players of the **2020-21 NBA Season** in terms of **Box Plus-Minus**.

The goal for this plot was to provide an overview of the best teams, both in terms of Offensive and Defense.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_team_advanced(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional/">NBA.com API</a> website in order to get the advanced team statistics I was looking for, namely **Offensive Efficiency** (which corresponds to the amount of points scored by a given team every 100 possessions) and **Defensive Efficiency** (which corresponds to the amount of points scored against a given team every 100 possessions)

This visualisation is a **mapping** of the 30 NBA teams in terms of Offensive and Defensive Efficiency.
The better a given team is at Offense and Defense, the higher and to the right its position is within the mapping.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the team logos.

In order to get a more complete picture of the situation, I used the `{ggiraph}` package to customize the geom points tooltip to add the selected team logo's name and relevant statistics using HTML and CSS.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_players_table(variable = "bpm", season = "2020-21")` and showcases teams efficiency in the **2020-21 NBA Season**.

<details>
<summary> Data and Visualisation Choices</summary>

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 1) The Data</h5>

The data necessary for this visualisation was partly scraped from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a> and from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html">basketball-reference</a>.

The goal for this table was to provide an overview of the evolution of Offensive Strategy and Offensive Efficiency in the 2010s.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_all_seas_team_shoot_split(start_season, end_season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a> in order to get the share of **shots taken by each team in each zone**, to see whether there was relevant conclusions to be made.
It turns out, indeed, that teams traded off mid-range shots (shots taken that were neither near the rim, nor behind the three point line) for three-point shots between 2011 and 2021 mostly.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_all_seas_team_shoot_split() %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```


* `{bbal_ref_rating(start_season, end_season, team)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html">basketball-reference</a> website in order to get the Offensive Efficiency (also called Offensive Rating) for each team, each season, between 2011 and 2021.
It turns out the average Offensive Efficiency kept rising between 2011 and 2021.

```{r echo=TRUE}
bbal_ref_rating() %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```



<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **parallel line chart and bar chart** of the evolution of average offensive efficiency on the one hand, and of the share of shots taken that are three point shots on the other hand.
It turns out that trading off mid-range shots for three point shots correlates nicely with offensive efficiency.

In order to get a more complete picture of the situation, I used the `{ggiraph}` package to customize the outlying geom points tooltip to add the selected team's name and relevant statistic using HTML and CSS.

I also used the `{patchwork}` package to show merge charts in the same visualisation.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the team logo.

In order to speed up the r code, I used the `{future}` version of the `{purrr}`package, the `{furrr}` package.

There is also a team argument to this function, so as to show the selected team's offensive efficiency evolution, on top of the League Average and outliers (season-highs and season-lows) on the one hand, and the selected team's shooting split evolution on the other hand.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_off_evo_interactive(team = "global")` and showcases **League Average** offensive efficiency and shooting split evolution from 2011-2012 until 2020-2021.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **Offensive Efficiency :** Offensive efficiency (or Offensive Rating) corresponds to the number of points scored by a team every 100 possessions. The higher the number the better the team is at offense
* **Mid-range shots :** Mid-range shots are shots that are neither worth 3 points nor near the basket. While they are typically scored at a higher percentage than 3 point shots since they are shorter-ranged, they typically yield much lower value in terms of efficiency as the percentage difference does not make-up for the difference in value

<summary> Data and Visualisation Choices</summary>

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 1) The Data</h5>

The data necessary for this visualisation was partly scraped from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a>, from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html">basketball-reference</a> and from <a href="https://hoopshype.com/salaries/">hoopshype.com</a>.

The goal for this visualisation was to explore the correlation between Team Performance (represented by Win Percentage) with given variables (roster salary, offensive efficiency or defensive efficiency for example).

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_team_standings(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Regular%20Season">NBA.com</a> website in order to get the **Team Standings**, to get the Win/Loss record for each team in a given season.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_team_standings(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```


* `{get_salaries(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://hoopshype.com/salaries/">hoopshype.com</a> website in order to get a table of the roster salary for each team in a given season.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_salaries(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```


* `{bballref_efficiency_season(season)}` & `{bballref_def_efficiency_season(season)}` <br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html">basketball-reference</a> website in order to get each team's offensive and defensive efficiency in a given season.

```{r echo=TRUE}
bballref_efficiency_season(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
bballref_def_efficiency_season(season = "2020-21") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```



<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **bump chart** of teams ranked by Win Percentage, and a specific variable (salary, off. efficiency or def. efficiency) in a given season, with a spotlight on the selected team.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the team logo.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_bump_chart(season = "2020-21", variable = "salary",team = "Phoenix Suns")` and explores the relationship between **Win Percentage** and **Salary** in the **2020-21 NBA Season**.
The **Phoenix Suns** look like the team that achieved the most from the least amount of salary roster.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **Offensive Efficiency :** Offensive efficiency (or Offensive Rating) corresponds to the number of points scored by a team every 100 possessions. The higher the number the better the team is at offense
* **Defensive Efficiency :** Defensive efficiency (or Defensive Rating) corresponds to the number of points scored against a team every 100 possessions. The lower the number the better the team is at defense

The goal for this table was to highlight the ranking of each team of a given **Conference** in a given season.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_team_standings(season)}`& `{get_team_advanced_selections(season)}` &`{get_traditional_stats(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Regular%20Season">NBA.com</a> website in order to get the **Team Standings** (in particular the Win/Loss record for each team in a given season), the **Advanced Team Statistics** (in particular Efficiency and other per possession based metrics) and **Player Statistics** (in order to highlight the scoring statistics of the leading scorer for each NBA team).

```



<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation is a **table** ranking of the NBA teams in terms of Win Percentage, in a given conference, in a given season.

I used the `{gt}` package to customize the table, but might decide to look into the `{reactable}` API for this visualisation in my final output, should I prefer an interactive table.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_teams_table("2019-20", conf = "West")` and gives thought-provoking information about teams from the **Western Conference** in the **2019-20 NBA Season**.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **Offensive Efficiency :** Offensive efficiency (or Offensive Rating) corresponds to the number of points scored by a team every 100 possessions. The higher the number the better the team is at offense
* **Defensive Efficiency :** Defensive efficiency (or Defensive Rating) corresponds to the number of points scored against a team every 100 possessions. The lower the number the better the team is at defense
* **Net rating :** The net rating is the difference between Offensive Efficiency and Defensive Efficiency. The higher the number the higher the overall value of the team
* **All-Star :** An All-Star is a player selected to participate to the NBA All-Star Game. It is an award typically granted to the 24 best players in the NBA

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 1) The Data</h5>

The data necessary for this table was partly scraped from the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com API</a>, from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html">basketball-reference</a>, from <a href="https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/allstar/game/rosters/2020">basketball.realgm.com</a> and from the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/history/awards/_/id/33">ESPN.com website</a>.

The goal for this table was to provide an **Overview** of the main events of the selected **NBA Season**, looking into the **NBA Finals**, the **NBA All-Star Game** and the winners of the main **NBA Awards**.

The main datasets at the source of the following visualisation are as follows :

* `{get_finals_stats(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&CFID=155&CFPARAMS=2020-21&TeamID=1610612747&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2020-21&section=team&sct=hex">NBA.com</a> website in order to get the result for all games in a specific **NBA Finals**, in order to visually represent the way the NBA Finals playet out.
As a reminder, the NBA Finals are a series between the winner of each Conference, in a Best Of 4 Games match-up, meaning the first team to win 4 games in the series wins the NBA Finals.

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_finals_stats(season = "2018-19") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```


* `{get_award_stats(award, .season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html">basketball-reference</a> website in order to get the relevant statistics for the recipient of a given **NBA Award** in a given **Season** (MVP, Finals MVP, Sixth Man of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player or Rookie of the Year).

```{r}
get_award_stats(award = "mvp", .season = "2018-19")
```


* `{get_all_stars(season)}`<br>
I scraped the <a href="https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/allstar/game/rosters/2020">basketball.realgm.com</a> website in order to get a table of the players that were honored with a selection to the **NBA All-Star Game** in a particular NBA Season

```{r echo=TRUE}
get_traditional_stats(season = "2018-19") %>% 
   rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 2) Visualisation choices</h5>

This visualisation regroups three different visualisations and aims at providing a **visual overview** of a given NBA Season.
The three combined visualisations are a **scatterplotted lollipop plot** that highlights the outcome of the NBA Finals, a **text plot** providing statistical insights about the recipients of the main NBA Awards and an **interactive facetted scatterplot** about the NBA All-Stars.

In order to get a more complete picture of the situation, I used the `{ggiraph}` package to customize the All-Stars geom points tooltip to add the selected player's team name and relevant statistic using HTML and CSS.

In order to give further visual upside to the chart, I used the `{ggtext}` package to plot the team logos and player pictures.

The `{patchwork}` package was used to combine the three visualisations.

In order to speed up the r code, I used the `{future}` package to run the three plotting functions in parallel.

This specific instance of the visualisation is the result of the function `plot_season_recap(season = "2020-21")` and provides a deep-dive into the **2020-21 NBA Season**.

<h5 class = "text-primary"> 3) Specific Definitions</h5>

* **All-Star :** An All-Star is a player selected to participate to the NBA All-Star Game. It is an award typically granted to the 24 best players in the NBA.
* **Sixth Man of the Year :** Sixth Man of the Year is an award granted to the player perceived as the best among players who start the game off the bench.
* **Rookie of the Year :** Rookie of the Year is an award granted to the player perceived as the best among new players.
